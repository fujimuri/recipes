    Ingredients:
    <ul>
        <li>Cauliflower</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Red lentils</li>
        <li>1 bunch Cilantro or Parsley</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    Cooking directions:
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the cauliflower and place in a pot. If you have a pot that fits
            the whole cauliflower, use it. If not, you can cut the cauliflower into
            a few chunks so that you can fit them all in the pot.
        </li>
        <li>Pour water into the pot until the cauliflower is submerged.</li>
        <li>Bring the pot to a boil. Add salt (about 1/2 tbsp) and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Keep cooking until fork goes through cauliflower easily.</li>
        <li>Remove cauliflower from water. Do not discard the water in the pot!</li>
        <li>Wait for the cauliflower to cool a bit. Meanwhile, make a soup with the
            leftover yummy water: add 1/2 cup of red lentils and cook until they
            fall apart. Then add chopped cilantro, cook 5 more minutes and the soup
            is done. Add salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle olive oil on your cauliflower, add salt and pepper to taste
            and put in an oven that was pre-heated to at least 200 c.
        </li>
        <li>Roast cauliflower until it gets golden brown spots, like in the picture.
            That can take a while, depending on the oven.
            Start checking after 20 minutes in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>That's it! You have a delicious roasted cauliflower and a flavorful
            soup.
        </li>
